# AdventuresOf___

The game is a semi-open world (limited to text) with many choices which will determine the player’s ending. There are two endings (Light and Dark). The ending of the game is determined by the number of times a player chooses a particular type of choice (e.g. if the user selects too many Dark options, they will get to the Dark ending of the game). The conditions for getting a Light ending would revolve around the player going for only Light or mostly Light options. Certain points of the game, however, will inevitably lead you to the Dark ending despite not doing any evil…

The GUI of the game remains basic, with black + white colours and no images. This is to give the game a classic effect which has been implemented in many other popular games (e.g. Undertale)

The title of the game starts off as Adventures of ___, however, after the player inputs their name, within the first form (Start.CS), and gets sent to Title.CS, it will change to Adventures of (playerName). The player’s name also gets used within the game the character refers to the player by their name. If the player does not input a name and clicks confirm, the player’s name will instead be “?” 

Constraints: Due to time constraints, certain dialogues within some sections are repeated, and the sequence is also quite similar. The text within the buttons varies which also changes the layout of the buttons. For the most part, however, the buttons are closely placed within the centre.

TIP: For the best experience, go through the light path, and go to the Old Saber Battlefield (which offers more gameplay + dialogue). To run the program, simply ensure all files are within the .zip file, then either press ctrl + f5 or just f5 to run the program.
